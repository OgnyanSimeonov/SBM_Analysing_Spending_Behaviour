# Sustainable banking: analysing spending behaviour and carbon emission patterns on community level through stochastic block models
Repository with supporting code for the article Sustainable banking: analysing spending behaviour and carbon emission patterns on community level through stochastic block models.

- SBM_for_Transaction_Networks.ipynb -- contains the network creation, community detection, and analyses we perform in our study
  
- sbmtm.py -- SBM methodology developed by Gerlach et. al (https://github.com/martingerlach/hSBM_Topicmodel); needed for SBM_for_Transaction_Networks.ipynb to work
  
- sbmtm_weights2.py -- SBM methodology with slight changes so that it incorporates arbitrary weights in the community detection
