# Analysing community-level spending behaviour contributing to high carbon emissions using stochastic block models
Repository with supporting code for the article Analysing community-level spending behaviour contributing to high carbon emissions using stochastic block models

- SBM_for_Transaction_Networks.ipynb -- contains the network creation, community detection, and analyses we perform in our study
  
- sbmtm.py -- SBM methodology developed by Gerlach et. al (https://github.com/martingerlach/hSBM_Topicmodel); needed for SBM_for_Transaction_Networks.ipynb to work
  
- sbmtm_weights2.py -- SBM methodology with slight changes so that it incorporates arbitrary weights in the community detection
